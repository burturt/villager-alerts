# villager-alerts

A simple plugin to alert users when a *local* villager is killed.

The configuration file (config.yml) allows you to adjust the distance from the player for which villager death messages will be shown, toggle displaying the coordinates of the villager, and change the message colour.

Message colours codes should be a single base 16 character (0-f), see https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php.

The command **/vareload** can be used to reload the configuration file on a live server.
